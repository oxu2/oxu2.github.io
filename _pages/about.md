I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, advised by Prof. [Yunhui Guo](https://yunhuiguo.github.io). 

Prior to that, I earned an M.S. in Statistics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison, following a B.S. in Mathematics from Southeast University. 

My research interests lie in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Specifically, I focus on Generative AI, Large Vision–Language Models, and Active Learning.

My Chinese name is 徐鸥旸.
